Overview
The analysis of hospital data from 2018 to 2021 has provided significant insights into the utilization of professional groups, patient waitlists for various specialties, and the demographic profiles of patients. These findings enable us to visualize the trends over time and prepare better for future healthcare demands.

Key Findings
Professional Utilization Trends:

The data revealed the professional groups most frequently utilized within the hospital. This information helps in understanding which specialties are in high demand and may require more resources and staffing.
Waitlist Analysis:

By examining the waitlists for each specialty, we can visualize the timeline of patient wait times. This analysis highlights periods of high demand and specialties with consistently long waitlists.
The ability to track these trends over four years allows for the identification of patterns and potential bottlenecks in patient care.
Demographic and Case Type Insights:

The demographic analysis provided a comprehensive overview of the age distribution, gender, and other relevant characteristics of the patient population.
Classifying patients into inpatient, day patient, and outpatient categories revealed trends in the types of care required and how these needs evolved over time.
Actionable Insights
Resource Allocation:

With a clear understanding of high-demand specialties, hospital administrators can allocate resources more effectively to areas that need them the most. This includes adjusting staffing levels, expanding facilities, or investing in specialized equipment.
Waitlist Management:

Tracking waitlist trends enables the hospital to implement strategies to reduce wait times, such as optimizing scheduling, increasing capacity in high-demand areas, and prioritizing cases based on urgency.
Future Preparedness:

The insights gained from this analysis serve as a valuable record for future planning. By anticipating trends and understanding the population's healthcare needs, the hospital can better prepare for future demands.
This includes strategic planning for facility expansions, training programs for healthcare professionals, and policy adjustments to improve patient care.
Conclusion
The comprehensive analysis of hospital data from 2018 to 2021 has equipped the hospital with the knowledge to make informed decisions about resource allocation, waitlist management, and future preparedness. By acting on these insights, the hospital can better meet the necessities of the population and ensure high-quality care for all patients.
