#Project Title: Hospital Specialties Utilization and Waitlist Analysis (2018-2021)
Overview
This project aims to analyze and identify the groups of professions most utilized within a hospital setting over a span of four years (2018-2021). Additionally, the project examines the waitlists for each specialty and explores the demographics, age distribution, and patient case types (inpatient, day patient, outpatient) during this period.

Objectives
Identify High-Demand Professions:

Determine which professional groups were most frequently utilized in the hospital from 2018 to 2021.
Analyze Waitlists:

Assess the waitlist lengths for each specialty to identify potential bottlenecks and areas needing improvement.
Demographic and Case Type Analysis:

Analyze the demographics of patients.
Classify patients as inpatient, day patient, or outpatient and analyze trends across these categories.
Data Sources
The data used in this project includes:

Professional Utilization Data: Records of the different professional groups used in the hospital.
Waitlist Data: Details of the waitlists for various specialties.
Demographic Data: Information about the patients' age, gender, and other relevant demographic details.
Case Type Data: Classification of patient cases into inpatient, day patient, or outpatient categories.
Methodology
Data Collection:

Gathered data from hospital records, including professional utilization logs, waitlists, and patient demographic information.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Merged datasets where necessary to create a comprehensive analysis-ready dataset.
Analysis:

Used descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
Employed statistical methods to analyze the waitlists for each specialty.
Conducted demographic analysis to understand the age distribution and other characteristics of the patient population.
Classified patient data into inpatient, day patient, or outpatient categories and analyzed the distribution and trends over the four years.
Results
High-Demand Professions:

Identified the top professional groups that were most utilized each year and observed trends over the four-year period.
Waitlist Analysis:

Analyzed the waitlists for each specialty, highlighting specialties with the longest waitlists and suggesting possible reasons for these trends.
Demographic Insights:

Provided insights into the age distribution, gender, and other demographic characteristics of patients.
Identified trends in the types of cases (inpatient, day patient, outpatient) over the four years.
Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the utilization of professional groups within the hospital, the dynamics of specialty waitlists, and the demographic profile of the patient population. The findings can help hospital administrators and policymakers make informed decisions to optimize resource allocation, reduce wait times, and improve patient care.

Future Work
Expand the analysis to include more recent data (post-2021) to identify ongoing trends.
Investigate the impact of external factors (e.g., seasonal variations, pandemics) on hospital utilization and waitlists.
Develop predictive models to forecast future waitlist lengths and professional group demand.
